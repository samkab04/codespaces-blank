_Note: For this project, you are allowed to use ChatGPT for portions of your program (will
be explained later), but you must exactly follow the prompt template and include both
your ChatGPT prompts and responses in your report._

# 1. Problem Statement:

(1) The goal of this programming assignment is to use iteration (for loops or while loops)
and condition statements (if statements or switch statements) to create a variety of
patterns using ASCII characters. Your task is to prompt the user for a size, and then
output the following five patterns:

**Solid Square Pattern**
```
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
```

**Vertical Stripe Pattern**
```
*   *   *
*   *   *
*   *   *
*   *   *
*   *   *
```

**Letter F Pattern**
```
* * * * *
*
* * *
*
*
```

**Letter T Pattern**
```
* * * * *
    *
    *
    *
    *
```

**Letter Z Pattern**
```
* * * * *
      *
    *
  *
* * * * *
```
The examples above all have size=5. Your program should work for any size in the range
[5..20], and do error checking to be sure the size is in this range. Since the size of the
pattern is an input parameter, it would be a very BAD idea to "hard code" the output of
patterns using cout statements. Instead, you need to use **nested loops** and **conditions** to
create the output patterns.

(2) After you have your code for printing the five patterns above working properly, use
ChatGPT (https://chatgpt.com/) to generate C++ code for printing patterns for the letters
A and R using the prompt below. **Note: you must write your own code first, then use it
to prompt the AI.**

# 2. Design:

Try to design the code to be as simple as possible. Start by making a square of solid *'s
for a given width. This can be done by looping over the square and printing an asterisk.
You may also want to print a space character so that the width and height of the square
look the same. Looping over the square can be achieved using **nested loops**. Finally, add
**if statements** to the code so that it prints an asterisk only when it is part of a pattern you
would like to print.

# 3. Implementation:

You can implement this program using either a bottom-up approach or a top-down
approach. If you go for a bottom-up approach, start by creating basic methods and
classes, and test these methods using a simple main program that calls each method.
When this is working, you can create the main program that uses these methods to solve
the problem above.

If you go for a top-down approach, start by creating your main program that reads user
input, and calls empty methods to pretend to solve the problem. Then add in the code for
these methods one at a time. This way, you will get an idea of how the whole program
will work before you dive into the details of implementing each method and class.

```
"Generate C++ code to print the letter [A/R] using nested loops.
Use the same style as this code for [F/T/Z] I wrote:
[PASTE YOUR C++ CODE FOR F/T/Z HERE]
"
```

Regardless of which technique you choose to use, you should develop your code
**incrementally** adding code, compiling, debugging, a little bit at a time. This way, you
always have a program that "does something" even if it is not complete

Integrate your code with the code generated by ChatGPT into a single program. The
program should print the solid square pattern, the stripe pattern, the letter F pattern, the
letter T pattern, the Z pattern, the letter A pattern, and the letter R pattern.

# 4. Testing:

Test your program to check that it operates correctly for all of the requirements listed
above. Also check for the error handling capabilities of the code. Try your program on 2-
3 input values and save a copy of your testing results in a file called “typescript.txt” to
upload with your project report.

# 5. Documentation:

When you have completed your C++ program, write a short report using the
“Programming Project Report Template” describing what the objectives were, what you
did, and the status of the program. Does it work properly for all test cases? Are there any
known problems?

Then, include the ChatGPT prompts and responses for letter patterns A and R. Write a
short paragraph discussing the code generated by ChatGPT. Did the AI generated code
work properly? How does your programming style compare to ChatGPT’s programming
style (e.g., loop structures, variable names). Save your report in a separate file to be
submitted electronically.

# 6. Project Submission:

In this class, we will be using electronic project submission to make sure that all students
hand their programming projects and labs on time, and to perform automatic plagiarism
analysis of all programs that are submitted.

When you have completed the tasks above go to Blackboard to upload your
documentation (report.docx or report.pdf), testing output (typescript.txt), and your C++
code (midpoint.cpp and project.cpp). Make sure you include your name in all of these
documents. Do not upload an executable version of your program.

The dates on your electronic submission will be used to verify that you met the due date
above. All late projects will receive reduced credit:

- 10% off if less than 1 day late,
- 20% off if less than 2 days late,
- 30% off if less than 3 days late,
- no credit if more than 3 days late.

You will receive partial credit for all programs that compile even if they do not meet all
program requirements, so handing projects in on time is highly recommended.


**7. Academic Honesty Statement:**

Students are expected to submit their own work on all programming projects, unless
group projects have been explicitly assigned. Students are NOT allowed to distribute
code to each other, or copy code from another individual or website. Students ARE
allowed to use any materials on the class website, or in the textbook, or ask the instructor
and/or GTAs for assistance.

This course will be using highly effective program comparison software to calculate the
similarity of all programs to each other, and to homework assignments from previous
semesters. Please do not be tempted to plagiarize from another student.

**AI Misuse: Using ChatGPT to generate C++ code for any of the five initial patterns
(square, stripe, letter F, T, or Z) will be considered a policy violation.**

Violations of the policies above will be reported to the Provost's office and may result in
a ZERO on the programming project, an F in the class, or suspension from the university,
depending on the severity of the violation and any history of prior violations.
